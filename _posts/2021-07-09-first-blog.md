Think this is my first excursion into Frontend.

Having been busy recently with writing my thesis recently, I don't have the time to do some Backend or Python stuff. In addition, I was inspired by [Yongfu Liao](https://yongfu.name/), which is a blog hosted by one of the best students in our institute. In a nutshell, these reasons mentioned above lead me to start a blog.

I know there is still a long way to go. I might have to overcome a lot more than the guy next to me, but that's what makes it all worth it.
